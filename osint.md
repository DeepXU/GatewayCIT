> "Open-source intelligence (OSINT) is data collected from publicly available sources to be used in an intelligence context." Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSINT#cite_note-1)

* [IntelTechniques.com](https://inteltechniques.com/links.html) provides an extensive list of useful tools for performing OSINT.
* [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) is a great research tool to find basic information about virtually any topic.

## Archives

* [The Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) allows you to search archives of hundreds of billions of Web pages even after the original website is taken down.
* [Archive.org](https://archive.org/) is an extensive archive of images, documents, books, etc. It is very useful for performing any kind of research.

## Search Engines

* [DuckDuckGo](http://duckduckgo.org/) is a privacy-respecting, general-purpose search engine with many useful features added by the open source community. It is particularly useful if you are searching for information about programming languages. There is also an [onionsite](https://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion/) for use on the Tor network.
* [not Evil](http://hss3uro2hsxfogfq.onion/) is an onion-site for searching the Tor network. It only returns results for websites that are not devoted to evil activities (ie. pornography, drug trafficking).
* [searx.me](https://searx.me/) is a powerful, privacy-respecting metasearch engine that pulls from dozens of other search engines. It has a tabbed interface for searching different categories (Files, Images, Social Media, etc.). There is an [onionsite](http://ulrn6sryqaifefld.onion/) for use on the Tor network.
* [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/) is a search engine for the Internet of Things (IoT) that allows you to find Internet-connected devices all over the world.

## Reverse Image Search

Reverse image searches allow you to upload an image and search the Web for similar images. This type of search is also useful when you want to determine the origin of a picture.

* [Bing Reverse Image Search](https://www.bing.com/images)
* [Google Reverse Image Search](https://images.google.com/)
* [Yandex Reverse Image Search](https://yandex.ru/images) is a Russian search engine, so it might turn up different results than Bing or Google.
