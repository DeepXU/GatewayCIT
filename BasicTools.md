The most important tool for the NCL is Kali Linux. Kali is a linux distrobution (operating system) designed for penetration testing, security, and hacking. You can download it from [https://www.kali.org/downloads/](https://www.kali.org/downloads/). You can burn the Kali ISO file to a flash drive with [Etcher](https://etcher.io/).

Familiarity with [BASH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)), [PowerShell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerShell), and Command Prompt will be very beneficial for the NCL competition.
